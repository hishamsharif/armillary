run.bat                             Batch file to help you run App.main()

Instructions
--------------------
1) Implement RoyalRumble.java
2) If you compile RoyalRumble into the same folder, you can use either run.sh or run.bat to help you run App.main()
3) If you use an IDE, you will have to setup your own workflow to run App.main() and pass the input file as parameter to the program.
4) Submit only RoyalRumble.java, and unit test files if you have written any.


Prerequisites
---------------------
1) Java 8  (The implementation is dependent on a Java 8 feature - Lambda/Stream )
